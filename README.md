Advantages of the Our Traffic Management System
Autonomous: There are no need of the Manpower
Dynamic System, Manages Traffic light switching according to current traffic density.
Less expensive than other solutions.
There are no need to new hardware to be installed.
Step by Step FlowChart of our Proposed System
Step 1 :- Capturing Vehicles Image Using CCTV At Traffic Signals
Step 2 :- Indetify The Vehicles and Calculate Number of the Vehicles
Step 3 :- Send Final Number of the Vehicles to AI
Step 4 :- AI Scheduling the Green Signal Time according to Traffic Density
Step 5 :- Updating traffic Signal Time

Some of the Factors That Our AI Considered While Switching Traffic Signals
The Processing Time of the Image Recognization System to Calculate traffic Density.
Lag each vehicle suffers during start up.
Average speed each catagory of Vehicles.
The no. of Lanes.
